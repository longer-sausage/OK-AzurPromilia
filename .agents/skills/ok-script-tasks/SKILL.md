description: Create and modify automation task classes for the ok-script Python library, including BaseTask one-time tasks, TriggerTask background tasks, task config UI metadata, registration in ok-script app config, custom ok_tasks scripts, and bilingual English/Chinese task behavior. Use when Codex needs to implement, refactor, review, or explain ok-script tasks in any project, independent of any particular app.

# OK Script Tasks

## Overview

Use this skill to create or modify tasks built on the PyPI `ok-script` library. Keep guidance generic to `ok-script`; inspect the current project only to discover its local base classes, scene helpers, feature names, and registration style.

When more detail is needed, read:

- `references/task-api.md` for task lifecycle, config, execution, GUI, and bilingual rules.
- `references/templates.md` for reusable one-time task, trigger task, feature/OCR, and registration templates.
- Use `$ok-script-i18n` after task creation when gettext catalogs need task strings added, synced, or compiled.

## Workflow

1. Inspect the target project for existing tasks, app config, and any project-specific base class.
   Prefer existing project helpers over inheriting directly from `BaseTask` when the project already has a base task class.
2. Decide the task type:
   - Use `BaseTask` or a project one-time base for user-started workflows that should finish and disable themselves.
   - Use `TriggerTask` for background checks that run repeatedly while enabled.
   - Mix in feature/OCR/project helpers only when the task actually needs them.
3. Add or update task metadata in `__init__`:
   `name`, `description`, `default_config`, `config_description`, `config_type`, `supported_languages`, icons, grouping, and scheduling flags.
4. Implement `run()` with small, observable steps.
   Use `self.log_info`, `self.log_warning`, `self.info_set`, `self.wait_until`, `self.next_frame`, `self.sleep`, `self.click_relative`, `self.find_one`, `self.wait_click_feature`, `self.ocr`, and `self.wait_ocr` instead of ad hoc polling or direct device calls.
5. Register the task according to the project style:
   built-in config list, `ok_tasks` custom task folder, or imported script package.
6. If the project uses gettext catalogs, sync task translations with `$ok-script-i18n`.
7. Validate with the project test or headless path when available.
   At minimum, import the task module and instantiate the class if device-dependent execution cannot be run.

## Bilingual Output

Support English and Chinese in both code review and generated code.

- Answer the user in the language they use. If unclear, use English with concise Chinese labels where useful.
- Prefer stable English config keys because config keys become persisted JSON fields. Add Chinese help in `config_description` or through the project's translation system.
- Include OCR match text for every active OCR locale of the target project instead of assuming a fixed language pair; in ok-end-field only `zh_CN` and `zh_TW` are active OCR locales (see `$ok-script-ocr-lang`).
- Use `supported_languages` only to hide a task in unsupported locales. Common locale names are `en_US`, `zh_CN`, `zh_TW`, `ja_JP`, `ko_KR`, and `es_ES`.
- Do not hard-code assumptions from the source project used to study `ok-script` unless the target project explicitly uses them.

## Config UI: Conditional Visibility and Numeric Ranges

`self.config_type[key]` accepts extra metadata for generated configuration UIs. `sub_configs` is honored by the shared resolver `ok/core/config_schema.py` and by the Qt card (`ok/ui/qt/tasks/ConfigCard.py`). The resolver also preserves `min` and `max` as `minimum` and `maximum` schema metadata for headless/web fields, including fields with `float` defaults; Qt widget behavior is described separately below.

- **`sub_configs`** — show child options only for specific parent values:

  ```python
  self.config_type["浮层信息"] = {
      "sub_configs": {True: ["浮层文字透明度", "浮层背景透明度", "浮层字号"]},
  }
  ```

  The rule maps *parent value* → *child keys*. A child is visible only when its parent's current value is a key of the map (lists union across selected values). A value with no entry (e.g. `False` here) hides every child. Children may themselves be parents, giving nested folding. Children are rendered indented, and the parent's switch/dropdown/multi-select drives updates live.
  Project example: `src/core/BattleConfig.py` (`KEY_ENABLE_ROTATION`), `src/tasks/onetime/DeliveryTask.py`.
  The parent must be a widget that emits change signals: bool → `SwitchButton`, `drop_down`, or multi-selection.

- **`min` / `max`** — on Qt config cards, these are numeric bounds for `SpinBox`. Only **int** defaults get a bounded `SpinBox`; a `float` default becomes a `DoubleSpinBox` that ignores `min`/`max`. This Qt limitation does not affect the headless/web schema: it still outputs `minimum` and `maximum` for fields with these keys, including `float` fields. Use an `int` default only when the Qt widget itself must enforce the bounds (e.g. a 0–100 opacity percentage or a pixel size), then convert to a float internally if needed.

- An explicit `config_type[key]["type"]` takes priority. Only when `type` is absent is the widget kind inferred from the **default value's type**, not the current value: `bool` → switch, `int` → `SpinBox`, `float` → `DoubleSpinBox`, `list` → list editor. Pick the default's type deliberately for this fallback path.

- Config keys and `config_description` strings are user-visible and must go through gettext (see `$ok-script-i18n`).

## Essential Rules

- Always call `super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)` before setting task fields.
- Do not bypass `Config`: set defaults in `self.default_config`; read values through `self.config.get(...)` after `after_init()` loads config.
- For `TriggerTask`, keep `self.default_config['_enabled']` intentional and set `trigger_interval` to avoid excessive polling.
- Return truthy from a trigger task only after it handled something meaningful; falsey return lets the executor continue scanning other trigger tasks.
- For one-time tasks, allow normal completion; the executor disables the task after `run()` returns.
- Keep direct sleeps short and use `wait_until`, `wait_ocr`, or `wait_click_feature` for state-dependent waiting.
- Avoid locale-specific config keys unless the project already follows that style.
